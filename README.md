# store-item-repo
This is a flask restful project. created a rest api's and api's are being tested with Postman 
and i used SQLite database.
ORM used in this project is SQLAlchemy. it is used to map the python classes and database objects
Instead writing the SQL queries manually Sqlalchcemy does that work.
